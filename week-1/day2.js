// Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.

// Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:

let age = null;
//null data type means nothing, empty.

let num;
console.log(num)
// type of returns the type of operands 
console.log(typeof "0")
